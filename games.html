			<h1>Games</h1>

			<h3>I take an interest in game emulators and open-source games that work on Linux. Here is a list of the best 
				emulators, roms, and open-source games I have found to date. I've attached a personal rating for each game, 
				but that's just my opinion.</h3>

			<h3>DOSBox - Microsoft DOS Emulator</h3>
			<h4>Best games for DOSBox</h4>
			<div class="allgames">

				<div class="row">
					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/aladdin.png">
						<h3>Aladdin 4.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Basic mario style game where you guide Aladdin through different maps which correspond to the original Disney Movie.
							Never finished this game, only gotten to about level 5 or 6.</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/alleycat.png">
						<h3>Alley Cat 3.5/5.0</h3>
						<h5>I still have no idea what the point of this game is or how to win. You control a cat that jumps through windows and
							does weird stuff. Like catching mice from a cheese block. This game is probably more nostalgic than actually good.</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/civilization.png">
						<h3>Civilization 4.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Actually a pretty fun game - never finished though. You build a civilization, grow it, fight, etc. Found it dificult to figure
							out exactly what to do which is probably why I didn't get too far into the game</h5>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/dune2.png">
						<h3>Dune 2 - 5.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Best DOS game in my opinion. A great strategy game that I think is loosely based off of the book Dune. Never completed it, I keep
							losing around level 5 or 6. Highly recommend.</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/heroesofmightandmagic.png">
						<h3>Heroes Of Might and Magic - 3.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Another game I haven't had a ton of experience with. You fight monster and explore a kingdom. Graphics look really nice.</h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/lionking.png">
						<h3>Lion King - 4.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Sad to say I haven't finished this game, even on easy mode. Actually come to think of it I don't think I've finished any
							of these games. Anyway another mario style game that revolves around following Simba. Yes, based on the lion king. First levels 
							are the best, I think I've again gotten to level 6.</h5>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/simcity.png">
						<h3>SimCity - 5.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>This might be the only game I've really "completed". As in my city got so big that the game just got too slow to really play. Fun game,
							takes some strategy, the whole point is to build your city without going bankrupt. </h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/simcity2000.png">
						<h3>SimCity 2000 - 4.5/5.0</h3>
						<h5>SimCity but 3D and new features. Fun game, haven't completed or built a really big city with this one. </h5>
					</div>

					<div class="game">
						<img src="assets/images/games/tetris.png">
						<h3>Tetris - 3.0/5.0</h3>
						<h5>Tetris, but on DOS. It's fun just like Tetris, but found remembering the controls difficult</h5>
