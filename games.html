			<h1>Games</h1>

			<h3>I take an interest in game emulators and open-source games that work on Linux. Here is a list of the best 
				emulators, roms, and open-source games I have found to date and where you can find and set them up. 
				For all Windows and Mac people I know, most of these probably work on them too, I've only used them
				on Linux though. I've attached a personal rating for each game, but that's just my opinion.</h3>

			<h3>DOSBox - Microsoft DOS Emulator</h3>
			<h4>Best games for DOSBox</h4>

				<h3>Aladdin 4.0/5.0</h3>
				<h5>Basic mario style game where you guide Aladdin through different maps which correspond to the original Disney Movie.
					Never finished this game, only gotten to about level 5 or 6.</h5>

                                <img src="assets/images/games/alleycat.png">
                                <h3>Alley Cat 3.5/5.0</h3>
                                <h5>I still have no idea what the point of this game is or how to win. You control a cat that jumps through windows and
					does weird stuff. Like catching mice from a cheese block. This game is probably more nostalgic than actually good.</h5>
                        </div>

			<div class="game">
                                <img src="assets/images/games/civilization.png">
                                <h3>Civilization 4.0/5.0</h3>
                                <h5>Actually a pretty fun game - never finished though. You build a civilization, grow it, fight, etc. Found it dificult to figure
					out exactly what to do which is probably why I didn't get too far into the game</h5>
                        </div>

			<div class="game">
                                <img src="assets/images/games/dune2.png">
				<h3>Dune 2 - 5.0/5.0</h3>
				<h5>Best DOS game in my opinion. A great strategy game that I think is loosely based off of the book Dune. Never completed it, I keep
					losing around level 5 or 6. Highly recommend.</h5>
                        </div>

                                <img src="assets/images/games/heroesofmightandmagic.png">
                                <h3>Heroes Of Might and Magic - 3.0/5.0</h3>
                                <h5>Another game I haven't had a ton of experience with. You fight monster and explore a kingdom. Graphics look really nice.</h5>
                        </div>

                                <h3>Lion King - 4.0/5.0</h3>
                                <h5>Sad to say I haven't finished this game, even on easy mode. Actually come to think of it I don't think I've finished any
					of these games. Anyway another mario style game that revolves around following Simba. Yes, based on the lion king. First levels 
					are the best, I think I've again gotten to level 6.</h5>
