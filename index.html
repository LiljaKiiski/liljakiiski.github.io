                	<h2>Hello person, I am Lilja</h2>

                	<h3>My main hobbies include:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Programming</li>
                		<li>Drawing</li>
                		<li>Doing homework</li>
			</ul>

                	<p>I mainly code in Java, and am in the process of learning C++. I don't really like web dev (html, css, javascript, etc.), but wanted to get a website up 
			and running so here it is. I work on a lot of different things, like LeetCode problems and sometimes making small games to learn new programming concepts. 
			You can find some of the bigger projects I have made from my <a href="https://github.com/LiljaKiiski">GitHub</a>.<p>

			<p>On the art side, normally if I draw it's game art for my programs. Sometimes I'll make a comic if I get a funny idea, but mostly I focus more
			on programming than on art. I guess it is handy I can draw my own images for games I make though, not a bad skill to have.</p>

			<p>And... that's pretty much it</p>
